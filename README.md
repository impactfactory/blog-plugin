# blog-plugin
A simple unfinished blog plugin as alternative to the Rainlab Blog Plugin.

As a generalist I was overwhelmed do always understand the code of the Rainlab Plugin. At some point I decided that Im faster with just setting up my own models, so I could add fields and templating easier.

DEPENDENCIES

- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery for languageswitcher
- impactfactory.team Plugin (just for displaying an author - could be rpleaced with user plugin.
